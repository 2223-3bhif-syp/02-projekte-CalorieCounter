== Description of the initial situation

We are a team of 5 students and attend the Higher Technical College in Leonding.

== Current state

There is currently no calorie counter app with the features that people want.

People tend not to count their calories and don't keep track of their calorie expenditure and calorie intake.

== Objective

The app should be fun to use and motivate more people to do sports and fitness.

== requirements (target)

The program should query the current and desired weight.

In addition, entered calories should be counted and evaluated.

The user gets suggestions on how to burn calories most efficiently.

Statistics should be available after a longer period of use.

== Administrative
